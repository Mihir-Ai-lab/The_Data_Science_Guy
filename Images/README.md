|02|Volatile Acidity|The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.| 
|03|Citric Acid|Found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wines.| 
|04|Residual Sugar | The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it’s rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter |
|||Wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet.|
|05| Chlorides| The amount of salt in the wine.|
|06| Free sulfur dioxide  | Free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion|
|||It prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.|
|07|  Total sulfur dioxide | Amount of free and bound forms of S02| 
|||In low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine|
|||At free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine|
|08| Density| The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content|
|09| pH | Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic);|
||| Most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.|
|10| Sulphates| A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.|
|11| Alcohol| The percent alcohol content of the wine.|
|12| Quality| Score between 0 to 10.|Images Collection for The Data Science Guy
